## Assent <sub>**A***pproval* **S***olution* **S***implified for* **ENT***erprise*<sub>
Microsoft Assent (*a.k.a Approvals*) as a platform provides the "one stop shop" solution for approvers via a model that brings together disparate different approval requests in a consistent and ultra-modern model. Approvals delivers a unified approvals experience for any approval on multiple form factors - Website, Outlook Actionable email, Teams. It consolidates approvals across organization's line of business applications, building on modern technology and powered by Microsoft Azure. It serves as a showcase for solving modern IT scenarios using the latest technologies.
- Payload Receiver Service API - Accepts payload from tenant system.
- Audit Processor - Azure Function that logs the payload data into Azure Cosmos DB.
- Primary Processor - Azure Function that processes the payload pushed by payload receiver service API to service bus.
- Notification Processor - Azure Function that sends email notifications to Approvers/ Submitters as per configurations.
- WatchdogProcessor - as per configurations from tenant sends reminder email notifications to Approvers for pending approvals as per configurations from tenant.
- Core Services API - Set of Web APIs to support the Approvals UI.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the project up and running in Azure.

### Pre-requisites

Before running the project on local machine/ or deploy the following things needs to be setup on Azure:
- Azure Subscription
- Microsoft Entra ID App (along with secret)

Apart from these keep the following items handy as it would be required during deployment:
- Microsoft Entra ID App's ClientId for Authentication in case of API
- Microsoft Entra ID App's Secret for Authentication in case of API
- Assign a default `user_impersonation` scope for the Microsoft Entra ID app (with Admin Consent only)
- Microsoft Entra ID App's resource/AAP ID URI used for generating token (audience)
- TenantId for Authentication in case of API
- Issuer Url for Authentication : https://sts.windows.net/{IdentityProviderTenantId}
- Custom Application Name which would be used to create AppServices/Functions (resource_name_prefix)
- Custom Resource Group Name where all the resources will be deployed
- Location/code to deploy the Azure Resources (e.g. Central US/centralus. Powershell Command: Get-AzureRmLocation |Format-Table)


### Installing

A step by step series of that explains how to get the components deployed in Azure

```
Step 1: Download the ARM template (template.json) from the source (scripts)
```

```
Step 2: Go to Azure Portal and search/select the service 'Deploy a custom template"
```

```
Step 3: Select 'Build your own template in the editor' and paste the content of 'template.json' in the editor
```

```
Step 4: Save and go the next step. Select the subscription, resource group & location.
Update the settings to update any of the parameter values if required and click on purchase

Note : If there is any failure, try re-deploying again before proceeding for any troubleshooting.
```

## Clean-up
It might have happened that some of the resources which got created may be already present in your subscription.
In that case, you can continue to use the same and delete the newly created resources. (e.g. Storage Account, Application Insights, ServiceBus - In case of ServiceBus make sure to create the Topics in your exisiting ServiceBus namespace before deleting).

The following table will help in deciding which components can be cleaned-up.

|Common||
|--------|------|
|  | App Configuration|
|  | KeyVault |
|  | Application Insights |
|  | ServiceBus Namespace |
|  | Storage Account |
|  | Cosmos Db |
|  | Azure Search |

## Setup and Configuration

Once all the components are deployed, go to the below components, copy the access keys and store that in Azure App Configuration.
**The secrets needs to be stored in Azure Key vault and a respective Key Vault reference of the same can be added in   Azure App Configuration as required.**

| Key Name | Source | In KeyVault ? |
|--------|------|--------|
| AzureAppConfigurationConnectionString | Azure App Configuration | Yes |
| ServiceBusConnectionString | ServiceBus | Yes |
| StorageConnectionString | Storage Account | Yes |
| StorageAccountName | Storage Account | No |

## Deploy
Deploy the code in these new components using Azure DevOps (Build and Release pipelines)

The deployment might fail sometimes due to locked files. Try restarting the service, before redeploying.
If the issue persists, add the following AppSettings in the service configuration
```
    "MSDEPLOY_RENAME_LOCKED_FILES": "1"
```
